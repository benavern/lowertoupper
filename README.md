node webkit app that permits you to convert a text in lower and upper case

Once, my girlfriend asked me if there was something easy to convert some words from lower to upper case and vice versa, I was not able to answer her... 

So, because I am a web programmer and I eard about node webkit, I said myself I'd test it and help her in the same time.

This is the result of what I gave here. She was happy with it, and I was happy too being able to code a software with my only knowledge in web programming.
